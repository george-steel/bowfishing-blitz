Bowfishing Blitz: A Game of Refractive Aberration
=================================================

A tribute to the minigames of the Zelda series, and a demonstration of a new technique for real-time water.
Made for Acerola Jam 0.

**Objective:** Smash as many pots as possible in three laps of the pond before time runs out.
Be careful, *water refracts light, but it does **not** refract arrows.* 
When shooting, remember that objects in water are deeper than they appear, and adjust your aim accordingly.
